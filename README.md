repo for my music configurations

AUM session:  I added automations to my AUM set-up so that the app is a little easier to use on iPhone where screen real estate is limited.  Here's a few of the great features from AUM I used:
 - emojis as channel names
 - channel bookmarks
 - midi ctrls:
   - key one for me was Scroll to Channel, so that I can move to a specified channel when I press a midi footswitch on my external controller
   - but also used show plugin, and mute/disable as a switcher
   - These are the controls used:
     - CC20:
     - CC21:
     - CC22:
     - CC23:  
 NOTE:  Using [this midi foot controller (or at least another rebrand of this same thing)](https://www.amazon.com/HHOP-Chocolate-Wireless-Controller-Rechargeable/dp/B0B8GCD2SS/ref=sr_1_12?crid=27VJTA52MWLR8&keywords=midi+foot+controller&qid=1696815425&sprefix=midi+foot+controlle%2Caps%2C187&sr=8-12)

TBD:  Siri Shortcuts Automation that uses Actions app to start up AUM and a few other music apps iff connected to my audio interface.  Will upload shortcut once tested.
