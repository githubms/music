# music

repo for my music configurations

AUM session:  I added automations to my AUM set-up so that the app is a little easier to use on iPhone where screen real estate is limited.  Here's a few of the great features from AUM I used:
 - emojis as channel names
 - channel bookmarks
 - midi ctrls:  the key one for me was Scroll to Channel, so that I can move to a specified channel when I press a midi footswitch on my external controller

TBD:  Siri Shortcuts Automation that uses Actions app to start up AUM and a few other music apps iff connected to my audio interface.  Will upload shortcut once tested.
